# Idea Orbiter

Idea Orbiter is a Flutter application designed to help you keep track of your ideas and tasks. It allows you to write down future projects or things you want to do, and the tasks will orbit and remind you about themselves from time to time.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks or ideas.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks to keep them up to date.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks that are no longer relevant.
- **Set as Done**: Mark tasks as completed.
- **Remind Tomorrow**: Set a reminder for the next day.
- **Remind at Date**: Schedule a reminder for a specific date.

## Notifications

Idea Orbiter will send you notifications to remind you about your tasks. For example, after 25 days, 50 days, or 100 days, you will receive a notification with the text:

```
Your idea {idea name} is waiting for you for {number of days} days.
```
